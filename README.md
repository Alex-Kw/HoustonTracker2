# HoustonTracker2
A music editor for TI graphing calculators


### About

HoustonTracker 2 is a software sequencer that enables you to create music on Texas Instruments graphing calculators. It uses the machines' communication port to output multi-channel 1-bit music. Its interface is inspired by popular trackers such as LSDJ, Famitracker, and Milkytracker.

HT2 supports several models of the Z80-based line of TI calculators. It is mainly targetted at older, obsolete models like the TI-82, but also works on TI-83,
TI-83Plus/SE, and TI-84Plus/SE.

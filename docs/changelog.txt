version 2.21.10
===============

NEW/CHANGES

- note table tuned to 440 Hz (and some notes produce more useful noise fx as a result)
- ch2 duty sweep (5xx, xx > 0x80) now has a configurable parameter (xx & 0x7f)
- effect 7xx (auto-chord) now has two modes: unsynced (regular) and synced (octave chord)
- volume rebalance: ch1 and drums have slightly increased volume, ch3 is a little quieter
- slowed down ch3 slides, 3xx now works like 2xx (xx is no longer inverse)
- 9xx temporarily disabled

BUGFIXES

- fixed user drum input glitch

Hello! 

So you decided to build a headphone amp for your texas instruments calculator! Good choice!

This is not really a normal headphone amp. It will only work with 1-bit signals. If you manage to put "normal music" through the "amp"
it will just be turned in to a squarewave and probably sound pretty distorted. 
This is because the heart of the thing is a cmos logic chip called CD4069 and all it does is take the squares 
coming from the calculator, inverts their phase and buffer them so that it can drive a couple of headphones. 
The PCB also includes a lowpass filter that tastfully cuts out a bit of the high frequency ripple coming from the calc. 
But no too much! =)

This folder countains all the stuff you should need to build your own amp. Either with the fritzing files or if you wanna order your 
own pcb just use the Gerber files at your favorite pcb-manufacturer. 

I take no responsibility for this thing. If your stuff breaks when using or building this its your fault. 
It worked well for me and its a pretty easy build so you should be fine. (FINGERS CROSSED)

Hope you´ll have many fun hours on the train or where ever you wanna sit with your calc.
Enjoy!
